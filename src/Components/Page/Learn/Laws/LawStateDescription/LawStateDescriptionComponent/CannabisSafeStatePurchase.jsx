            <p  className="isWeedLegalParagraph">
            SB 46 has legalized medical marijuana, allowing patients and caregivers to buy a 60-day supply of medical cannabis once dispensaries are operational. Daily supply limits, determined by recommending physicians, usually can't exceed 50mg unless certain conditions apply. Forms of medical cannabis include capsules, creams, gels, lozenges, oils, tablets, tinctures, and more. While there are no regulations for CBD products under 0.3% THC, selling products with higher THC content is a felony carrying penalties of imprisonment and fines. CBD products are commonly found in CBD shops, health stores, and even pharmacies in Alabama. Online purchase options are available, 
            but payment methods can vary due to CBD's status as a "restricted business" for some processors.
