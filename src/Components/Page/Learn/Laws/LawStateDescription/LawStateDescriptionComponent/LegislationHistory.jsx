                    In 2014, Governor Robert Bentley introduced a modification to Alabama's criminal code, referred to as Carly's Law. This amendment allowed the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) to administer non-psychoactive CBD oil to children suffering from seizures for a clinical study.

                    In the subsequent year, Senator Bobby Singleton proposed the Medical Marijuana Patient Safe Access Act, which aimed to grant patients with 25 severe medical conditions access to medical cannabis. Unfortunately, this bill did not progress to a Senate floor vote.

                    Fast forward to July 1, 2016, when Leni's Law was enacted as an amendment to Carly's Law. This revision granted the permanent use and possession of CBD oil to individuals diagnosed with debilitating medical conditions, as determined by their physicians.

                    In July 2019, Governor Kay Ivey signed SB 225 into law. This legislation redefined and rescheduled CBD in accordance with the federal definitions outlined in the 2018 Farm Bill. Moreover, it permitted Alabama pharmacies to sell CBD products.

                    Alabama's potential move towards medical marijuana legalization was interrupted in early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Compassion Act, known as SB 165, was approved by the Senate but was not voted on in the House as the legislative session ended prematurely.

                    However, in mid-2021, the issue of medical marijuana was revisited, resulting in the successful passage of SB 46, the Darren Wesley 'Ato' Hall Compassion Act. This law legalized medical cannabis for 16 specific conditions when other treatments had failed or when marijuana was the recommended course of action. Notably, the law prohibited cannabis consumption on school premises and lacked safeguards for patients requiring medical marijuana in work settings. Additionally, the legislation imposed a residency requirement not only for patients but also for businesses to prevent an influx of recreational marijuana producers.

                    To facilitate the implementation of SB 46, the Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission was established. This commission was tasked with creating a registry system and issuing licenses for processors, transporters, testing labs, and dispensaries. The Department of Agriculture and Industries assumed responsibility for regulating and licensing cannabis cultivation within the state.
