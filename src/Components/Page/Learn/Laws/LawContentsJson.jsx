                            <p>In 2014 Gov. Robert Bentley signed an amendment to the state's criminal code that became known as Carly's Law.
                                It enabled the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) to provide non-psychoactive CBD oil to children with seizures as part of a clinical study. </p>
                            <p>Sen. Bobby Singleton in 2015 proposed the Medical Marijuana Patient Safe Access Act,
                                which would have enabled patients with 25 severe medical conditions to access medical cannabis.
                                The bill never reached the Senate floor for a vote.</p>
                            <p>On July 1, 2016, Leni's Law was passed to amend Carly's Law,
                                permanently allowing the possession and use of CBD oil by those suffering from a debilitating medical condition as diagnosed by their physician. </p>
                            <p>In July 2019, Gov. Kay Ivey signed SB 225,
                                which redefined and rescheduled CBD to align with federal definitions in the 2018 Farm Bill and allowed Alabama pharmacies to sell CBD products. </p>
                            <p>Alabama seemed poised to legalize medical marijuana in early 2020 when life in America ground to a halt amid the coronavirus pandemic.
                                The Senate passed SB 165, the Compassion Act, by a solid margin but the House,
                                which seemed to support the bill, never got a chance to vote as the legislature adjourned early. </p>
                            <p>In mid-2021 the state took up the issue of medical marijuana again and this time the bill made it all the way and was signed by Gov. Ivey in May.
                                SB 46, the Darren Wesley 'Ato' Hall Compassion Act, legalized medical cannabis for a list of 16 conditions if other treatments had failed or marijuna is the standard of care. The law outlaws consumption on school grounds and provides no protection for patients who may need to use medical marijuana while working. The legislation includes a residency requirement not just for patients but also for businesses,
                                to avoid “an influx of companies engaged in the recreational production of marijuana.” </p>
                            <p>SB 46 set up the Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission to create the registry system,
                                and license processors, transporters, testing labs, and dispensaries.
                                It tasked the Department of Agriculture and Industries with licensing and regulating cannabis cultivation in the state.</p>

                                When they are, patients and caregivers will be able to purchase up to a 60-day supply of medical cannabis. Recommending physicians determine what a daily supply is but it can't exceed 50mg a day,
                                unless the patient hasn't responded to treatment for 90 days or is diagnosed with a terminal condition. Then it can be 75mg a day. </p>

                            <p>There are no regulations for sales of CBD products that fall below the 0.3% THC threshold.
                                Selling any cannabis product containing more than the legal amount of THC is a felony that carries a sentence of two to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $30,000.
                                Sales of cannabis to a minor can be punishable by a ten years-to-life sentence and a maximum $60,000 fine.</p>
                            <p>Typically, CBD products are sold at CBD-specific shops and wellness and health food stores.
                                In Alabama,pharmacies can sell CBD products over the counter, as long as they are sourced from legal producers and
                                contain no more than 0.3% THC.  </p>
                            <p>Consumers may also purchase CBD products online, typically directly through a specific brand's website.
                                Many online checkout processes work for CBD companies based in the United States,
                                but some online processors consider CBD a “restricted business,” so not all payment methods may be available</p>

                            <p>Cultivation is illegal in Alabama. An individual cultivating a marijuana plant at home for personal use can be charged with trafficking cannabis,
                                which is considered a felony. Except for patients and caregivers, possessing any amount of processed cannabis is considered a misdemeanor with up to one year in prison or a $6,000 fine.

                                is illegal in Alabama except in the form of CBD oil derived from hemp with less than 0.3% THC.
                                Medical cannabis is also legal for registered patients and caregivers.</p>

                                Any path to legalize marijuana would have to go through the state legislature.

                        <p>With the passage of Measure 2 in 2014, Alaska became the third state to legalize recreational cannabis.
                            Medical cannabis use was legalized in 1998 after voters approved the Alaska Medical Marijuana Initiative, or Measure 8</p>

                        <p>Alaska was the second state in the U.S. to decriminalize cannabis after President Richard Nixon passed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act in 1971. In 1975,
                            the state legislature imposed a $100 fine for possession, effectively decriminalizing the plant while stopping short of legalizing it.</p>
                        <p>Also that year the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in Ravin v. State that Alaskan adults had the right to use and possess a small amount of cannabis for personal use, according to Alaska's constitutional rights to personal privacy. In 1982, the $100 fine was removed. In 1986,
                            the Alaska legislature decriminalized the possession of up to 4 ounces of marijuana (113.4 grams) in the home and up to 1 ounce (28.35 grams) outside of the home.</p>
                        <p>However, the pendulum swung back toward prohibition in the late 1980s. On the heels of multiple cannabis trafficking busts, voters in 1990 approved the Alaska Marijuana Criminalization Initiative, or Ballot Measure 2.
                            This law made possession of small amounts of marijuana a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail or a $1,000 fine.</p>
                        <p>The pendulum of public opinion swung again in 1998 when voters passed the Alaska Medical Marijuana Initiative, or Measure 8, a bill that legalized medical cannabis use for qualifying individuals. While the measure legalized cannabis possession and use,
                            there was no legal way for patients and caregivers to obtain the plant.</p>
                        <p>Anti-cannabis sentiment gained the upper hand in 2006 when the legislature once again criminalized possession. This law was heavily pushed by Republican Gov. Frank Murkowski,
                            who was publicly against cannabis use.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Alaska's Measure 2, or The Alaska Marijuana Legalization Initiative, was approved by 53% of voters in 2014, which allowed for the regulation, production, sale, and use of recreational cannabis.
                            The measure went into effect in February 2015. </p>
                        <p>Republican Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer signed off on the state's approved regulations for onsite consumption on March 12, 2019, and the laws went into effect on April 11, 2019. The onsite consumption rules give each local government jurisdiction
                            over its own county and the ability to determine its own onsite regulations.</p>
                        <p>Measure 2's passage changed the Alcohol Beverage Control Board into the Alcohol and Marijuana Control Office (AMCO),
                            which established the Marijuana Control Board (MCB) in 2015 to regulate and govern recreational cannabis use.</p>

                content: <div>
                    <p>Since the introduction of legislation in April 2017 to allow adult-use cannabis in Canada, Alberta marijuana laws have changed and legalization arrived on Oct. 17, 2018.</p>
                    <p>Despite what many observers say is a relatively conservative political climate in the province, Albertans have been strong consumers of cannabis. According to Statistics Canada's 2017 Cannabis Provincial and Territorial Economic Accounts,
                        Alberta cannabis consumption per capita stands at No. 3 among 13 provinces and territories. Alberta leads the nation by far in consumption of medical marijuana compared with its overall use.</p>
                    <p>However, not all towns in the province are taking as strict an approach. In the 5,000 population mountain resort town of Jasper, the City Council in August 2018 voted to put no limits on the number of cannabis stores, allow them to remain open until midnight and asked to remove the provincial 100-meter buffer zone between retailers and schools or hospitals.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, in Banff, the local government is banning smoking or vaping in public and placing a number of restrictions on cannabis stores.</p>
                    <p>After the national bill was passed, Alberta produced a framework for cannabis in fall 2017, and in November 2017 passed acts to control and regulate cannabis and reduce marijuana- and alcohol-related driving. In 2018, gaming and liquor statutes were amended to account for adult-use cannabis. On March 6, 2018, the province began accepting applications for retail licenses.</p>
                    <p>The provincial government has enacted fairly strict regulations on stores and added penalties for impaired driving beyond federal penalties.</p>
                    <p>Under Alberta marijuana laws, medical marijuana has been legal since 2001, and regulations for medicinal use remain in effect.</p>
                    <p>The province took steps to increase penalties for driving while impaired.</p>
                    <p>Driving while impaired is illegal nationally, and Alberta has imposed additional penalties and regulations. Alberta has adopted a zero-tolerance policy for the presence of THC for new drivers without regular licenses and in the process of the Graduated License Program. Penalties include a 30-day license suspension and seizure of the vehicle for seven days.</p>
                    <p>Drivers suspected of impaired driving  who do not provide a fluid sample, or are over the legal limits for alcohol, cannabis, or combination of the two, face:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>an immediate 90-day license suspension</li>
                        <li>three (3)-day vehicle seizure, or seven (7)  days for a second occurrence</li>
                        <li>a mandatory education program, and</li>
                        <li>one-year participation in a provincial ignition interlock program, or one (1)-year license suspension.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>According to Alberta marijuana laws, the legal limit for THC in the bloodstream is 2 nanograms per milliliter. A nanogram is one-billionth of a gram. Concentrations between two (2) and five (5) nonograms result in a fine up to $1,000. Concentrations of five (5) or more nanograms will result in a $1,000 minimum fine on the first offense, imprisonment of 30 days or more for a second offense, and 120 days or more on a third offense.
                        Penalties for drug-impaired driving crashes can range from 18 months to as much as life in a fatal accident.</p>
                    <p>In Alberta, possession of fewer than five (5) grams by anyone younger than 18 will not be criminal but will result in the marijuana being seized, parents being notified, and a ticket.
                        Possession by a minor of more than five grams will result in criminal prosecution for minors.</p>
                    <p>Providing marijuana to a minor is punishable by a $5,000 fine and up to 14 years in jail.</p>

                    <p>Cannabis will be sold in privately owned, government-monitored stores that must acquire their cannabis from a federally-approved supplier. The businesses must be cannabis and accessory specialty stores and separate from alcohol, tobacco, and pharmaceuticals.
                        Adult use consumers can also purchase their cannabis online.</p>
                    <p>No cap has yet been set on the number of stores. However, they must be outside a 100-meter buffer zone from other dispensaries, hospitals and schools. To avoid monopolization,
                        no owner or entity may have more than 15 percent of the existing business licenses at a time.</p>
                    <p>The maximum allowable hours of operation are 10 a.m. to 2 a.m., seven days a week,
                        but can be reduced by municipalities. Stores can only buy cannabis wholesale from the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission (AGLC).</p>
                    <p>The AGLC will be responsible for all online adult-use cannabis sales beginning the first day of national legalization, set for Oct. 17, 2018. Any other online sales are illegal.</p>
                    <p>Retail stores will be permitted to sell a maximum of 30 grams, or 1.06 ounces, of dried cannabis to an individual in a single transaction.</p>
                    <p>Mandatory background checks are required for all retailers and workers, who must be at least 18 years old and complete the province's Sell Safe program. Licenses will not be given to applicants with links to organized crime or convictions for crimes such as drug trafficking</p>

                    <p>In Alberta cannabis smoking will be allowed on private property and residences with the landowner's approval. For rental properties, landlords can write-in or continue cannabis smoking restrictions similar to those for smoking tobacco and other substances.
                        Landlords can also add restrictions to grow beyond those imposed by the federal government.</p>
                    <p>Smoking marijuana outdoors and public spaces is left up to municipalities, with some, such as Edmonton,
                        tightening restrictions on all smoking and others, such as Calgary, implementing complete public smoking bans.</p>

                    <p>Consumers will be limited to 30 grams, or 1.06 ounces, of cannabis per transaction. Consumer education will be embedded in the retail of cannabis, and retail outlets will display point-of-purchase signs and other materials to educate customers about making responsible choices about cannabis.</p>
                    <p>The province allows possession by adults of up to 30 grams of cannabis in a public place. In a vehicle, cannabis must be stored in a sealed container that is not accessible during transport to the driver or passengers.
                        The government has set equivalencies for one gram of dried cannabis to equal five (5) grams of fresh cannabis; 15 grams, or 0.53 ounces, of edibles; 70 milliliters of liquid; 0.25 grams of concentrate; and one plant seed.
                    </p>
                    <p>Premade edibles and extract will not be available until one year after the legislation is passed, although consumers can create their own edibles.</p>
