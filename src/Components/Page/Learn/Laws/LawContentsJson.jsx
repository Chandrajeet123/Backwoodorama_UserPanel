                            <p>As the societal attitude towards marijuana undergoes a seismic shift across the United States, many states have begun to reassess their stance on its legality. Arkansas, nestled in the heart of the South, has also joined this nationwide conversation. But is weed legal in Arkansas? The answer is yes, with certain regulations in place.</p>

                            <p>In the southeastern corner of the United States, Alabama stands as a state known for its rich history and cultural tapestry. However, when it comes to marijuana, the state's legal landscape is not as diverse. It sheds light on Alabama's marijuana laws, exploring its legality, legislative journey, possession limits, purchasing options, consumption restrictions, lab testing protocols.</p>

                            <p>Recreational marijuana is not legal in Alabama. The state has maintained its stance against recreational use, adhering to a strict prohibition. Possession of marijuana in personal quantities is a misdemeanor, while repeated possession or possession with intent to sell is a felony.</p>

                            <p>In 2014, Governor Robert Bentley introduced a modification to Alabama's criminal code, referred to as Carly's Law. This amendment allowed the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) to administer non-psychoactive CBD oil to children suffering from seizures for a clinical study.</p>
                            <p>In the subsequent year, Senator Bobby Singleton proposed the Medical Marijuana Patient Safe Access Act, which aimed to grant patients with 25 severe medical conditions access to medical cannabis. Unfortunately, this bill did not progress to a Senate floor vote.</p>
                            <p>Fast forward to July 1, 2016, when Leni's Law was enacted as an amendment to Carly's Law. This revision granted the permanent use and possession of CBD oil to individuals diagnosed with debilitating medical conditions, as determined by their physicians.</p>
                            <p>In July 2019, Governor Kay Ivey signed SB 225 into law. This legislation redefined and rescheduled CBD in accordance with the federal definitions outlined in the 2018 Farm Bill. Moreover, it permitted Alabama pharmacies to sell CBD products.</p>
                            <p>Alabama's potential move towards medical marijuana legalization was interrupted in early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Compassion Act, known as SB 165, was approved by the Senate but was not voted on in the House as the legislative session ended prematurely.</p>
                            <p>However, in mid-2021, the issue of medical marijuana was revisited, resulting in the successful passage of SB 46, the Darren Wesley 'Ato' Hall Compassion Act. This law legalized medical cannabis for 16 specific conditions when other treatments had failed or when marijuana was the recommended course of action. Notably, the law prohibited cannabis consumption on school premises and lacked safeguards for patients requiring medical marijuana in work settings. Additionally, the legislation imposed a residency requirement not only for patients but also for businesses to prevent an influx of recreational marijuana producers.</p>
                            <p>To facilitate the implementation of SB 46, the Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission was established. This commission was tasked with creating a registry system and issuing licenses for processors, transporters, testing labs, and dispensaries. The Department of Agriculture and Industries assumed responsibility for regulating and licensing cannabis cultivation within the state.</p>

                                For recreational users, possession of marijuana remains illegal in Alabama. The Compassion Act introduced possession limits for medical marijuana patients, allowing them to possess up to 70 daily dosages of medical cannabis. Cultivation by patients or caregivers is still prohibited under Alabama law.

                            <p>SB 46 has legalized medical marijuana, allowing patients and caregivers to buy a 60-day supply of medical cannabis once dispensaries are operational. Daily supply limits, determined by recommending physicians, usually can't exceed 50mg unless certain conditions apply. Forms of medical cannabis include capsules, creams, gels, lozenges, oils, tablets, tinctures, and more. While there are no regulations for CBD products under 0.3% THC, selling products with higher THC content is a felony carrying penalties of imprisonment and fines. CBD products are commonly found in CBD shops, health stores, and even pharmacies in Alabama. Online purchase options are available, but payment methods can vary due to CBD's status as a "restricted business" for some processors.</p>

                            <p>Before medical cannabis products become available, they must undergo thorough testing to ensure their safety and quality. This testing covers various aspects such as cannabinoid content, potency, presence of chemical contaminants, heavy metals, microbes, mycotoxins, residual pesticides, growth regulators, solvents, and terpenes.</p>
                            <p>In Alabama, the Department of Agriculture and Industries imposes specific testing requirements. Seed and crop testing is a necessity to confirm that CBD products contain no more than 0.3% THC. Furthermore, processors are obligated to conduct tests for pesticides in accordance with the existing agricultural pesticide laws. While there isn't a mandatory rule for displaying test results on product labels or in stores, retailers are responsible for retaining the test results for each product and must provide these results to customers upon request. This rigorous testing process is designed to ensure that medical cannabis adheres to high standards of quality and safety.</p>

                        <p>With the passage of Measure 2 in 2014, Alaska became the third state to legalize recreational cannabis.
                            Medical cannabis use was legalized in 1998 after voters approved the Alaska Medical Marijuana Initiative, or Measure 8</p>

                    content: <div>
                        <p>Alaska was the second state in the U.S. to decriminalize cannabis after President Richard Nixon passed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act in 1971. In 1975,
                            the state legislature imposed a $100 fine for possession, effectively decriminalizing the plant while stopping short of legalizing it.</p>
                        <p>Also that year the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in Ravin v. State that Alaskan adults had the right to use and possess a small amount of cannabis for personal use, according to Alaska's constitutional rights to personal privacy. In 1982, the $100 fine was removed. In 1986,
                            the Alaska legislature decriminalized the possession of up to 4 ounces of marijuana (113.4 grams) in the home and up to 1 ounce (28.35 grams) outside of the home.</p>
                        <p>However, the pendulum swung back toward prohibition in the late 1980s. On the heels of multiple cannabis trafficking busts, voters in 1990 approved the Alaska Marijuana Criminalization Initiative, or Ballot Measure 2.
                            This law made possession of small amounts of marijuana a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail or a $1,000 fine.</p>
                        <p>The pendulum of public opinion swung again in 1998 when voters passed the Alaska Medical Marijuana Initiative, or Measure 8, a bill that legalized medical cannabis use for qualifying individuals. While the measure legalized cannabis possession and use,
                            there was no legal way for patients and caregivers to obtain the plant.</p>
                        <p>Anti-cannabis sentiment gained the upper hand in 2006 when the legislature once again criminalized possession. This law was heavily pushed by Republican Gov. Frank Murkowski,
                            who was publicly against cannabis use.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Alaska's Measure 2, or The Alaska Marijuana Legalization Initiative, was approved by 53% of voters in 2014, which allowed for the regulation, production, sale, and use of recreational cannabis.
                            The measure went into effect in February 2015. </p>
                        <p>Republican Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer signed off on the state's approved regulations for onsite consumption on March 12, 2019, and the laws went into effect on April 11, 2019. The onsite consumption rules give each local government jurisdiction
                            over its own county and the ability to determine its own onsite regulations.</p>
                        <p>Measure 2's passage changed the Alcohol Beverage Control Board into the Alcohol and Marijuana Control Office (AMCO),
                            which established the Marijuana Control Board (MCB) in 2015 to regulate and govern recreational cannabis use.</p>

                        <p>Medical marijuana was first approved by Arizona voters in 1996 through an initiative allowing seriously or terminally ill patients to possess medical marijuana with a doctor's prescription.
                            This provision was overturned due to the word “prescribe” conflicting with federal law forbidding marijuana prescriptions.
                        </p>
                        <p>Arizona tried again to legalize medical cannabis in 2002, with Proposition 203, but it only earned 42.7% of the vote. A viable solution was not approved until nearly 10 years later. Voters in 2010 passed the Arizona
                            Medical Marijuana Question, a much-revised Proposition 203, by a slim margin — 50.13% of the vote. After Proposition 203 passed, the first medical marijuana sales didn't take place until December 2012. </p>
                        <p>Proposition 203 named the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) as the agency responsible for developing and implementing rules and regulations for the Arizona medical cannabis program. The initiative set out certain parameters used by ADHS for qualifying patients and caregivers to receive access to medical marijuana as well as operating regulations for licensed cannabis dispensaries.</p>
                        <p>The Smart and Safe Act appeared as Proposition 207 on the general election ballot in Arizona in November 2020.
                            Arizonans voted in favor of legalizing recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. The passage of this ballot initiative allowed adults over age 21 to possess 1 ounce (28 grams) of marijuana with no more than 5 grams of cannabis concentrates and to cultivate up to six cannabis plants at their primary residence. The ballot initiative also imposed a 16% excise tax on cannabis and allowed for the expungement of some criminal records for marijuana possession. Sales began in January 2021, marking the fastest move from voter approval to sales of any US state.

                        <h2>What are the laws on medical marijuana use in the workplace in Arizona?</h2>
                        <p>Arizona's medical marijuana statute does not allow employers to discriminate against a medical marijuana cardholder when hiring, firing, or penalizing based solely on their status as a cardholder unless the employer would lose federal benefits by not doing so. A positive drug test can't be held against a patient unless they used, possessed, or were impaired by cannabis while at work or on the premises during working hours. However, being a medical marijuana patient does not allow anyone to do anything while under the influence that could be considered negligence or professional malpractice. Patients also can't possess or use medical marijuana on any school property, including buses, or in a jail or prison. Operating a vehicle, plane, or boat while impaired is illegal. </p>

                            <p>As the societal attitude towards marijuana undergoes a seismic shift across the United States, many states have begun to reassess their stance on its legality. Arkansas, nestled in the heart of the South, has also joined this nationwide conversation. But is weed legal in Arkansas? The answer is yes, with certain regulations in place.</p>

                            <p>While recreational cannabis for adults is not allowed in Arkansas, individuals with specific medical conditions can use medical marijuana with the consent of their physicians. In the year 2020, the Arkansas Recreational Marijuana Initiative didn't gather sufficient signatures to be included in the regular election vote. This initiative aimed to legalize marijuana consumption in the state for individuals aged 21 and above. There's a possibility that this proposal might be reconsidered during the next election period.</p>

                            <p>Before medical cannabis was legalized in Arkansas, there were significant developments:</p>
                            <p>In 2006, Eureka Springs took the lead by enacting a voter initiative that downplayed the enforcement of marijuana-related offenses, indicating a shift in the city's stance.</p>
                            <p>Following Eureka Springs' example, Fayetteville followed suit in 2007 by passing a similar voter initiative, signaling a growing trend in prioritizing different approaches to marijuana-related issues.</p>
                            <p>The pivotal turning point came on November 8, 2016, when Arkansas voters made a significant decision:</p>
                            <p>Arkansas voters, by a majority of 53%, endorsed the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Amendment (AMMA), also known as Issue 6.</p>
                            <p>This amendment permits individuals with serious medical conditions to access and use medical marijuana, provided they have the approval of a medical professional.</p>
                            <p>The AMMA also lays the groundwork for the issuance of licenses for both state-sanctioned cultivation facilities and dispensaries, solidifying a regulated framework for the medical marijuana industry in the state.</p>

                            <p>While marijuana has seen a shift in its legal status, it's important to understand the possession and cultivation limits in Arkansas. As of my last update in September 2021, adults aged 21 and over are allowed to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal use. Moreover, individuals can cultivate a limited number of marijuana plants at their private residence, with a maximum of six flowering plants.</p>

                            <p>Yes, marijuana is legal in California, both for medical and recreational use.

                            <p>In 1996, California voters made history by passing Proposition 215, commonly known as the Compassionate Use Act. This groundbreaking initiative allowed patients and caregivers to legally possess and cultivate marijuana for medical purposes. It was a pivotal moment, marking the first successful medical marijuana ballot initiative at the state level in the United States. The passage of Senate Bill 420 in 2003 further solidified and clarified the provisions of Proposition 215, outlining its implementation and guidelines.</p>
                            <p>Fast forward to November 8, 2016, when California voters once again made a resounding statement by passing the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, or Proposition 64. This measure not only legalized the sale, possession, cultivation, and consumption of cannabis for non-medical purposes by adults aged 21 and older but also introduced taxes on sales and cultivation. This marked a significant step towards a more inclusive and comprehensive approach to cannabis use.</p>
                            <p>Recognizing the need for refinement, the California legislature took action in June 2017 with the passage of the Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA). Effective from January 1, 2018, this act addressed challenges that had arisen from Proposition 64 and aimed to streamline licensing requirements and clarify rules pertaining to medical marijuana. Importantly, MAUCRSA established a unified regulatory entity responsible for overseeing both medical and recreational cannabis operations: the Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC). Oversight duties were also shared with the state's departments of agriculture and public health.</p>
                            <p>Acknowledging the complexities and financial strains on businesses due to regulatory intricacies, the state underwent another transformative change in mid-2021. The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) emerged as a singular agency, consolidating regulatory oversight functions that were previously distributed across various departments, including the Department of Food and Agriculture and the Department of Consumer Affairs. This consolidation aimed to create a more efficient and cohesive regulatory framework for the cannabis industry.

                            <p>When it comes to marijuana, Colorado stands out as a pioneer in the United States. The Centennial State took a bold step in 2012 by legalizing the recreational use of cannabis for adults. Since then, it has become a model for other states exploring similar legislation.</p>

                        content: <div>
                            <p>The roots of Colorado's progressive cannabis landscape can be traced back to the year 2000 when a monumental shift occurred through the approval of Initiative 20 by the state's voters. This initiative, later solidified as Amendment 20 and enshrined within article XVIII, section 14 of Colorado's constitution, marked a turning point. Its significance lay in the legalization of medical marijuana and the establishment of an innovative identification card system tailored for patients and their caregivers. Notably, this marked the inception of a framework that would eventually harmonize medical and recreational cannabis laws under the comprehensive umbrella of the Colorado Revised Statutes (CRS) Title 44, Article 10.</p>
                            <p>Fast forward to November 6, 2012, and another pivotal moment was etched in Colorado's history. The passage of the Colorado Marijuana Legalization Amendment, popularly referred to as Amendment 64, was a resounding declaration of the state's evolving stance on cannabis. Article XVIII, section 16 of the state's constitution became the canvas for this amendment, a canvas on which the freedom to enjoy recreational cannabis was painted for adults aged 21 and above. Beyond personal consumption, Amendment 64 set the groundwork for a regulated system that encompassed the taxation, cultivation, and sale of recreational cannabis, solidifying Colorado's distinction as a trailblazing state in the realm of cannabis legalization.</p>
                            <p>In the dynamic year of 2019, the narrative expanded further with the introduction of House Bill 1230. This legislative milestone opened doors to a diverse range of cannabis-related ventures, including marijuana lounges and tasting rooms. This innovative approach allowed consumers to partake in the consumption of marijuana and its infused products, irrespective of whether the purchase was made on-site or elsewhere. This move not only provided consumers with novel experiences but also bolstered the state's cannabis-based hospitality industry.</p>
                            <p>Guiding these transformative changes are the vigilant hands of regulatory bodies. The Colorado Department of Revenue (CDOR) assumes the crucial role of overseeing Colorado's marijuana laws and its burgeoning adult-use cannabis sector. Through its stewardship, the department not only ensures compliance with legal frameworks but also orchestrates the licensing, testing, production, and distribution facets of both medical and recreational marijuana. The Colorado Medical Marijuana Registry, on the other hand, operates under the watchful eye of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), underscoring the state's dedication to upholding health and safety standards in its cannabis endeavors.
                                In this intricate tapestry of legislation and regulation, Colorado's cannabis journey continues to unfold, reflecting a commitment to balancing personal freedom with responsible governance.

                            <p>As a result of this legislation, individuals are allowed to purchase, possess, and consume cannabis responsibly. The law permits possession of up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis outside one's home and up to 5 ounces at home or within a vehicle's locked container, glove box, or trunk. This extends to equivalent quantities of cannabis concentrate and other related products, equating to 7.5 grams of concentrate or 25 grams of other cannabis derivatives.These legislative actions underscore Connecticut's commitment to fostering a more inclusive, equitable, and compassionate approach to cannabis use, aligning with evolving attitudes and understanding surrounding this versatile plant.</p>

Jack Markell signed the Delaware Medical Marijuana Act (DMMA), permitting eligible patients to purchase and utilize cannabis for medical purposes. The momentum continued in 2015 with the passage of Delaware House Bill 39 (HB 39), effectively decriminalizing cannabis possession across the state. This meant that possessing less than 6.2 ounces (175 grams) of marijuana became a misdemeanor, while having less than 1 ounce (28 grams) of the substance was reclassified as a civil infraction. Building on this progress, Gov. John Carney's approval of Senate Bill 37 in 2019 resulted in an amendment to the state's criminal code. This change enabled individuals with a single cannabis-related misdemeanor or felony to have their record expunged after five or seven years, respectively. </p>
                            <p>Although efforts to legalize adult-use cannabis through Delaware House Bill 110 were unsuccessful in 2018 and subsequent attempts in 2019 did not advance past the House, the state continues to push forward. The Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) plays a pivotal role, housing the Office of Medical Marijuana (OMM), which diligently oversees the Medical Marijuana Program (MMP). Through the OMM, a comprehensive framework has been established, encompassing patient and caregiver registries, qualification protocols, and stringent regulations. This infrastructure ensures the responsible availability of medical cannabis, prioritizing both safety and efficacy.</p>

                        content: <div>
                            <p>Within Delaware's regulatory framework, legal possession of medical cannabis is confined exclusively to registered patients and their designated caregivers. These authorized individuals are permitted possession of up to 6 ounces (170 grams) of medical cannabis at any given time, but it's important to note that regulations set by the Office of Medical Marijuana (OMM) strictly prohibit home cultivation for both patients and caregivers. </p>
                            <p>
                                Despite the decriminalization of cannabis possession in small quantities under the provisions of HB 39, it's crucial to clarify that this legislation didn't equate to full legalization for personal use. Even possession of less than an ounce can lead to a civil penalty, where individuals are required to surrender the cannabis. This civil penalty, amounting to $100, does not result in a formal recorded offense. However, holding more than an ounce could potentially lead to a misdemeanor charge carrying a $575 fine and a three-month prison sentence.

                            <p>Delaware's medical marijuana program extends provision for designated caregivers to aid registered patients in procuring and administering their prescribed medication. The caregiver qualification process is rigorous and entails undergoing background checks and adhering to specific prerequisites. To legally purchase medical cannabis for a patient, caregivers must obtain a Designated Caregiver ID card. These caregivers should be at least 21 years old or the parent/legal guardian of a minor patient, a resident of Delaware, committed to aiding the patient's medical cannabis use, and limited to assisting no more than five qualifying patients. The application procedure mandates a $125 fee for each patient, encompassing submission of the patient's 10-digit registry number, along with evidence of a $65 payment to the State Bureau of Identification for a criminal background report to be dispatched to the Office of Medical Marijuana (OMM).</p>

                            <p>Yes, but with limitations. Florida has legalized medical marijuana for qualified patients, allowing access to cannabis for specific medical conditions. However, recreational use of marijuana remains illegal in the state.</p>

                            <p>In 2014, the Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act was enacted in Florida, enabling severely ill patients with conditions like cancer and epilepsy to utilize low-THC cannabis. The Florida Department of Health (DOH) established the Office of Compassionate Use (OCU) to oversee the state's medical cannabis program. Governor Rick Scott signed the Florida Right to Try Act in 2015, empowering physicians to offer experimental treatments to seriously ill patients, including non-FDA-approved medicines. In March 2016, the scope of this act expanded to include low-THC and medical cannabis through HB 307. Florida's medical landscape saw a pivotal shift with the passage of the Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative (Amendment 2) in November 2016, securing over 70% voter approval. This amendment not only broadened medical cannabis legalization but also diversified the list of qualifying conditions. The OCU transitioned into the Office of Medical Marijuana Use (OMMU), and the establishment of Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers (MMTC) was mandated. Responsible for regulatory oversight, the Office of Medical Marijuana Use, under the state Department of Health, now plays a pivotal role in Florida's medical cannabis program.</p>
                            <h2>Cannabis Possession in Florida</h2>
                            <p>Florida's categorization of cannabis encompasses two distinctions: low-THC cannabis and medical marijuana. For cannabis to fall within the low-THC category, components like flowers, seeds, resin, and other derivatives must contain no more than 0.8% THC and over 10% CBD by weight. Patients and caregivers are subject to possession limits, with a cap on possessing more than a 70-day supply of cannabis, all of which must be retained in its original packaging. Patient purchases are confined to a maximum 35-day supply (2.5 ounces) or ownership of more than 4 ounces of smokable cannabis at any single instance. The transfer of marijuana is restricted solely to caregivers purchasing and transporting for designated patients, serving no other purposes.</p>

                            <p>Licensed Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers (MMTCs) are the authorized dispensaries where medical marijuana can be purchased in Florida. These centers provide a range of cannabis products, from flowers to oils and edibles, under strict regulatory guidelines.</p>
                            <h2>Finding Licensed Dispensaries in Florida</h2>
                            <p>Florida residents can locate licensed MMTCs through the Florida Department of Health's Office of Medical Marijuana Use (OMMU) website. This ensures safe and legal access to medical cannabis products.</p>

                            <p>Florida law prohibits the public consumption of marijuana, whether for medical or recreational purposes. Consumption is generally confined to private residences, ensuring discretion and compliance with the law.</p>
                            <h2>Is Home Cultivation Allowed in Florida?</h2>
                            <p>No, home cultivation of marijuana for personal use is not permitted in Florida. All cannabis products must be obtained through licensed MMTCs.</p>

                            <p>Georgia's journey in cannabis legislation witnessed pivotal moments that reshaped the landscape of medical access. The enactment of HB 1, often referred to as the Haleigh's Hope Act, served as a catalyst by establishing a patient registry designed for those with qualifying conditions, granting them permission to possess oil containing less than 5% THC by weight. Governor Nathan Deal's endorsement of this bill in April 2015 marked a turning point, though it notably omitted provisions for in-state sales of the oil.</p>
                            <p>In a subsequent move on May 9, 2018, Governor Deal endorsed SB 16, a milestone in broadening patient access to low-THC oil. Taking effect in July 2018, this legislation not only expanded the scope of qualifying conditions but also extended the privilege to Georgia's hospice care residents to procure low-THC oil, further emphasizing the state's commitment to compassionate care.</p>
                            <p>Another leap occurred with the introduction of Georgia's Hope Act, HB 324, in July 2019. This pivotal legislation ushered in the legalization of purchasing low-THC oil by registered patients. Beyond that, it established an integrated system for cultivation, production, and dispensation within the state's borders. Oversight was entrusted to the Georgia Access to Medical Cannabis Commission, operating under the Secretary of State's purview. Moreover, the act defined a maximum possession limit of 20 fluid ounces of oil, solidifying the regulatory framework for patient access.</p>

                            <p>The 2014 milestone arrived with the Joaquin (KC) Concepcion II Compassionate Cannabis Use Act, empowering patients with qualifying medical conditions to possess and consume cannabis. This pivotal law directed the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to establish a patient registry issuing ID cards and a framework for producing and distributing medical marijuana within the territory. Born from a 2013 proposal, validated by voter approval in 2014, and inked by the governor in 2015, this law set the precedent.</p>
                            <p>In 2016, Bill No. 343-33 emerged, broadening the scope of qualifying conditions, enabling physicians to recommend marijuana to patients they believed would benefit. It delineated possession limits, established the Medical Cannabis Regulation Commission, mandated comprehensive marijuana testing, and introduced optional patient registry cards while requiring them for caregivers.</p>
                            <p>The legislative landscape further evolved in 2018 with Public Law 34-125, permitting patients and caregivers to cultivate cannabis at home while dispensaries were in the works.</p>
                            <p>The pivotal year of 2019 saw the passage of Bill 32-35, the Guam Cannabis Industry Act (Public Law 35-5). A watershed moment, this act legalized buying, selling, consuming, and sharing cannabis for adults aged 21 and above. With visionary foresight, the law established the Cannabis Control Board (CCB), entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing and regulating cultivation, production, transportation, and retail sales across the island.</p>
                            <p>This chronicle of Guam's marijuana legislation journey underscores a transformation that spans patient access, medical provisions, caregiver roles, cultivation liberties, and the historic opening of the adult-use cannabis frontier. The story of Guam's cannabis laws continues to unfold, shaped by its dedication to creating a balanced framework for both medical patients and responsible adult users.</p>

                            <p>Guam has embraced the medical potential of cannabis. Qualified patients with debilitating medical conditions can access medical marijuana through a regulated system. This system ensures that patients receive the care they need while maintaining quality standards for medical cannabis products.</p>
                        <h2>Caregiving</h2>
                        <p>In Guam's medical marijuana program, caregivers play an indispensable role, standing as pillars of support for qualifying patients seeking relief through cannabis. Endowed with the authority to aid patients in accessing and utilizing medical cannabis, caregivers are integral to the program's success. They embark on a carefully orchestrated registration journey, a process meticulously designed to ensure the security and wellness of patients. These caregivers must be Guam residents aged 21 or above and are permitted to assist up to five patients, acting as dedicated guides in the realm of medical cannabis.</p>
                        <p>As a testament to Guam's commitment to responsible caregiving, while patient registration remains voluntary, caregivers are mandated to register and carry their registration card at all times—whether they're procuring, cultivating, or transporting cannabis on behalf of their patients. The meticulous approach safeguards the integrity of the program and fortifies the bond between caregivers and patients.</p>
                       <p>In scenarios where caregivers cultivate plants for multiple patients, stringent guidelines are enforced. The plants must either flourish within the homes of patients or caregivers or be centralized at a single cultivation site. This stipulation ensures accountable cultivation practices and adheres to the essence of patient-focused caregiving.</p>
                        <p>Distinguishing between cultivation scopes, caregivers are authorized to nurture plants for up to three patients sans the need for a cultivation license. For those caring for a larger number—up to five patients—a special commercial cultivation license comes into play, requiring a nominal fee of $10 per patient. This pragmatic approach echoes Guam's dedication to fostering a responsible and inclusive medical marijuana framework.</p>
                        <p>Caregivers stand as guardians of wellness, forging a crucial bridge between patients and the benefits of medical cannabis. Their pivotal role, fortified by stringent regulations, signifies Guam's unwavering commitment to patient-centered care within the realm of medical marijuana. </p>

                    title: "Is weed legal in Alberta?",
                    content: <div>
                        <p>Since the introduction of legislation in April 2017 to allow adult-use cannabis in Canada, Alberta marijuana laws have changed and legalization arrived on Oct. 17, 2018.</p>
                        <p>Despite what many observers say is a relatively conservative political climate in the province, Albertans have been strong consumers of cannabis. According to Statistics Canada's 2017 Cannabis Provincial and Territorial Economic Accounts,
                            Alberta cannabis consumption per capita stands at No. 3 among 13 provinces and territories. Alberta leads the nation by far in consumption of medical marijuana compared with its overall use.</p>
                        <p>However, not all towns in the province are taking as strict an approach. In the 5,000 population mountain resort town of Jasper, the City Council in August 2018 voted to put no limits on the number of cannabis stores, allow them to remain open until midnight and asked to remove the provincial 100-meter buffer zone between retailers and schools or hospitals.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, in Banff, the local government is banning smoking or vaping in public and placing a number of restrictions on cannabis stores.</p>
                        <p>After the national bill was passed, Alberta produced a framework for cannabis in fall 2017, and in November 2017 passed acts to control and regulate cannabis and reduce marijuana- and alcohol-related driving. In 2018, gaming and liquor statutes were amended to account for adult-use cannabis. On March 6, 2018, the province began accepting applications for retail licenses.</p>
                        <p>The provincial government has enacted fairly strict regulations on stores and added penalties for impaired driving beyond federal penalties.</p>
                        <p>Under Alberta marijuana laws, medical marijuana has been legal since 2001, and regulations for medicinal use remain in effect.</p>
                        <p>The province took steps to increase penalties for driving while impaired.</p>
                        <p>Driving while impaired is illegal nationally, and Alberta has imposed additional penalties and regulations. Alberta has adopted a zero-tolerance policy for the presence of THC for new drivers without regular licenses and in the process of the Graduated License Program. Penalties include a 30-day license suspension and seizure of the vehicle for seven days.</p>
                        <p>Drivers suspected of impaired driving  who do not provide a fluid sample, or are over the legal limits for alcohol, cannabis, or combination of the two, face:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>an immediate 90-day license suspension</li>
                            <li>three (3)-day vehicle seizure, or seven (7)  days for a second occurrence</li>
                            <li>a mandatory education program, and</li>
                            <li>one-year participation in a provincial ignition interlock program, or one (1)-year license suspension.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>According to Alberta marijuana laws, the legal limit for THC in the bloodstream is 2 nanograms per milliliter. A nanogram is one-billionth of a gram. Concentrations between two (2) and five (5) nonograms result in a fine up to $1,000. Concentrations of five (5) or more nanograms will result in a $1,000 minimum fine on the first offense, imprisonment of 30 days or more for a second offense, and 120 days or more on a third offense.
                            Penalties for drug-impaired driving crashes can range from 18 months to as much as life in a fatal accident.</p>
                        <p>In Alberta, possession of fewer than five (5) grams by anyone younger than 18 will not be criminal but will result in the marijuana being seized, parents being notified, and a ticket.
                            Possession by a minor of more than five grams will result in criminal prosecution for minors.</p>
                        <p>Providing marijuana to a minor is punishable by a $5,000 fine and up to 14 years in jail.</p>

                            Adult use consumers can also purchase their cannabis online.</p>
                        <p>No cap has yet been set on the number of stores. However, they must be outside a 100-meter buffer zone from other dispensaries, hospitals and schools. To avoid monopolization,
                            no owner or entity may have more than 15 percent of the existing business licenses at a time.</p>
                        <p>The maximum allowable hours of operation are 10 a.m. to 2 a.m., seven days a week,
                            but can be reduced by municipalities. Stores can only buy cannabis wholesale from the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission (AGLC).</p>
                        <p>The AGLC will be responsible for all online adult-use cannabis sales beginning the first day of national legalization, set for Oct. 17, 2018. Any other online sales are illegal.</p>
                        <p>Retail stores will be permitted to sell a maximum of 30 grams, or 1.06 ounces, of dried cannabis to an individual in a single transaction.</p>
                        <p>Mandatory background checks are required for all retailers and workers, who must be at least 18 years old and complete the province's Sell Safe program.

                            Landlords can also add restrictions to grow beyond those imposed by the federal government.</p>
