                            <p>In 2014 Gov. Robert Bentley signed an amendment to the state's criminal code that became known as Carly's Law.
                                It enabled the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) to provide non-psychoactive CBD oil to children with seizures as part of a clinical study. </p>
                            <p>Sen. Bobby Singleton in 2015 proposed the Medical Marijuana Patient Safe Access Act,
                                which would have enabled patients with 25 severe medical conditions to access medical cannabis.
                                The bill never reached the Senate floor for a vote.</p>
                            <p>On July 1, 2016, Leni's Law was passed to amend Carly's Law,
                                permanently allowing the possession and use of CBD oil by those suffering from a debilitating medical condition as diagnosed by their physician. </p>
                            <p>In July 2019, Gov. Kay Ivey signed SB 225,
                                which redefined and rescheduled CBD to align with federal definitions in the 2018 Farm Bill and allowed Alabama pharmacies to sell CBD products. </p>
                            <p>Alabama seemed poised to legalize medical marijuana in early 2020 when life in America ground to a halt amid the coronavirus pandemic.
                                The Senate passed SB 165, the Compassion Act, by a solid margin but the House,
                                which seemed to support the bill, never got a chance to vote as the legislature adjourned early. </p>
                            <p>In mid-2021 the state took up the issue of medical marijuana again and this time the bill made it all the way and was signed by Gov. Ivey in May.
                                SB 46, the Darren Wesley 'Ato' Hall Compassion Act, legalized medical cannabis for a list of 16 conditions if other treatments had failed or marijuna is the standard of care. The law outlaws consumption on school grounds and provides no protection for patients who may need to use medical marijuana while working. The legislation includes a residency requirement not just for patients but also for businesses,
                                to avoid “an influx of companies engaged in the recreational production of marijuana.” </p>
                            <p>SB 46 set up the Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission to create the registry system,
                                and license processors, transporters, testing labs, and dispensaries.
                                It tasked the Department of Agriculture and Industries with licensing and regulating cannabis cultivation in the state.</p>

                                Sales of cannabis to a minor can be punishable by a ten years-to-life sentence and a maximum $60,000 fine.</p>

Except for patients and caregivers, possessing any amount of processed cannabis is considered a misdemeanor with up to one year in prison or a $6,000 fine.

                                Any path to legalize marijuana would have to go through the state legislature.

                        <p>With the passage of Measure 2 in 2014, Alaska became the third state to legalize recreational cannabis.
                            Medical cannabis use was legalized in 1998 after voters approved the Alaska Medical Marijuana Initiative, or Measure 8</p>

                        <p>Alaska was the second state in the U.S. to decriminalize cannabis after President Richard Nixon passed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act in 1971. In 1975,
                            the state legislature imposed a $100 fine for possession, effectively decriminalizing the plant while stopping short of legalizing it.</p>
                        <p>Also that year the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in Ravin v. State that Alaskan adults had the right to use and possess a small amount of cannabis for personal use, according to Alaska's constitutional rights to personal privacy. In 1982, the $100 fine was removed. In 1986,
                            the Alaska legislature decriminalized the possession of up to 4 ounces of marijuana (113.4 grams) in the home and up to 1 ounce (28.35 grams) outside of the home.</p>
                        <p>However, the pendulum swung back toward prohibition in the late 1980s. On the heels of multiple cannabis trafficking busts, voters in 1990 approved the Alaska Marijuana Criminalization Initiative, or Ballot Measure 2.
                            This law made possession of small amounts of marijuana a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail or a $1,000 fine.</p>
                        <p>The pendulum of public opinion swung again in 1998 when voters passed the Alaska Medical Marijuana Initiative, or Measure 8, a bill that legalized medical cannabis use for qualifying individuals. While the measure legalized cannabis possession and use,
                            there was no legal way for patients and caregivers to obtain the plant.</p>
                        <p>Anti-cannabis sentiment gained the upper hand in 2006 when the legislature once again criminalized possession. This law was heavily pushed by Republican Gov. Frank Murkowski,
                            who was publicly against cannabis use.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Alaska's Measure 2, or The Alaska Marijuana Legalization Initiative, was approved by 53% of voters in 2014, which allowed for the regulation, production, sale, and use of recreational cannabis.
                            The measure went into effect in February 2015. </p>
                        <p>Republican Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer signed off on the state's approved regulations for onsite consumption on March 12, 2019, and the laws went into effect on April 11, 2019. The onsite consumption rules give each local government jurisdiction
                            over its own county and the ability to determine its own onsite regulations.</p>
                        <p>Measure 2's passage changed the Alcohol Beverage Control Board into the Alcohol and Marijuana Control Office (AMCO),
                            which established the Marijuana Control Board (MCB) in 2015 to regulate and govern recreational cannabis use.</p>
